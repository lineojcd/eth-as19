Principles of protein folding

[script](lecture1-protein-folding.pdf)

Lectures 1-5 will cover basic principles of protein folding, including

* The definition of the protein folding problem
* Spectroscopic methods for recording protein folding
* Equilibrium thermodynamics of protein folding:
    * Determination of the free energy of folding using denaturants
    * Temperature dependence of protein folding, enthalpy/entropy compensation in protein folding
* Protein folding kinetics
    * Kinetics of two-state folding
    * Phi value analysis for characterizing the transition state of folding
    * Folding via kinetic intermediates
    * Interrupted refolding experiments for detection of native molecules in protein folding kinetics
    * Slow reactions in protein folding: Proline cis/trans isomerization and disulfide bond formation

#### Lectures 6-8 (October 28 - November 11, 2019) E. Weber-Ban

Large Cellular Complexes in Protein Quality Control: Molecular Chaperones & Protein Degradation

1. [Protein Quality Control - Molecular Chaperones](MolecularChaperones_2019.pdf) 
    The role molecular chaperones in the protein quality control of cells will be discussed, including general principles as well as individual examples of specific molecular chaperone families.

2. PQC - Molecular Chaperones Assignment 
In this folder you find all the information for working on the assignment on the Lecture "PQC - Molecular Chaperones".

3. Protein Quality Control - Cellular Protein Degradation

[Lecture 1](ProteinDegradation_2019_1.pdf)

[Lecture 2](ProteinDegradation_2019_2.pdf)

In the first lecture, the role of protein degradation in protein homeostasis and cellular quality control will be discussed. You will get to know the principle of compartmentalizing protein degradation by chaperone-proteases. The mechanisms of the protease as well as the ATPase components of these complexes will be addressed.

The second lecture will focus on the eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We will discuss the mechanism of ubiquitination and why this post-translational protein modification is so versatile. The architecture and function of the 26S proteasome degradation complex itself will also be discussed.

4. Assignment PQC - Cellular Protein Degradation
The assignment should consolidate your understanding of the chaperone-protease architecture, the role played by the AAA protein components of the complex and the translocation mechanism of protein substrates.
5. Self-assessment questions
Use the questions to review the lecture block on protein quality control and protein turnover.
